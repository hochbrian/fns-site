    <h1>Friday Night Shindig</h1>
	<h3>Hoch Haus</h3>
	<p>In a house on Spofford, there lived the Hochs. Not a nasty, dirty, wet house filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy house with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a Hoch Haus, and that means <span class="logo">Friday Night Shindigs</span>.</p>
	<h5>What is Friday Night Shindig?</h5>
	<p>The Shindig is about community. We want to bring people from all different circles together. It started as a way to offer a home cooked meal to airmen at the local Air Force base.</p>
